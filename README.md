# StudentPerformance

### This project analizes the StudentPerformance.csv file and checks for trends and correlations.

### First, I have went over the data cleaning process in student performance.sql file. Turns out, there were no duplicate rows, no empty data points, no need for standartization. So we Good!

### In the same document, I have conducted a data exploration process and identified some trends. 

### Yet, I still encouraged myself to check my guesses and hypthesis regarding the original data through Python pandas and numpy libraries. 
### I also visualized the correlations, trends using the pandas libraries' methods. All the code can be found in StudentPerformance.ipynb file.
### The files are in the repository
